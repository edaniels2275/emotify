# Emotify

For this group project, the user is taken to a login page where they put in a username. They are then taken to a page that asks how they are feeling and presents six different emotions, and a random GIF relating to each emotion is loaded onto the page. When the user clicks an emotion, they are taken to a new page that plays a song relating to the user's selected mood. The user selects if they like or dislike or the song, and if they like the song they are presented with three related artists and embedded videos of songs from each artist on YouTube. If the user dislikes the song, they are taken back to the emotions page. 

The Gifs are generated by using AJAX to call the Giphy API. The related artists and embedded YouTube links are generated using AJAX to call the Tastedive API. 

Future modifications for this app would be to have the user input their own emotion rather than choosing from a pre-selected list. Then, based off the user's input, the app will generate its own playlist (rather than a single song) based on the user's input. If the user doesn't like the current song, then the app would move to the next song in the playlist rather than taking the user back to the homescreen.
